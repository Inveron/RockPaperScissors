# RockPaperScissors
Rps project i coded in javascript per the Odin Projects cirriculumn.


I have technically done this project before about like 7-10 months ago now. I spent days on it and in the end it barely ran. This time,
it was much easier, finished in basically half an hour and it runs a lot better than i thought it would have.
